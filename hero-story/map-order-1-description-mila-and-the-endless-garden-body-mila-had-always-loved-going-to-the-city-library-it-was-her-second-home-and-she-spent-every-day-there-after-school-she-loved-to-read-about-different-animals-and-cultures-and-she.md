`Mila had always loved going to the city library. It was her second home, and she spent every day there after school. She loved to read about different animals and cultures, and she dreamed of one day visiting the Amazon Rainforest just like her hero, Dr. Isabelle Tartaglia. So when Mila found out that Dr. Tartaglia was going to be giving a talk at the library, she was ecstatic.Mila arrived early to get a good seat, but when she got there, she saw that the room was already full of people. She didn't know what to do, until she saw a little girl sitting by herself in the back corner. The girl had big blue eyes and was wearing a dress with a thousand different colors. Mila went over to introduce herself.The girl's name was Lila, and she told Mila that she was from the Endless Garden. Mila had never heard of such a place, but Lila said that it was a magical place where anything was possible. Mila was immediately intrigued.Lila told Mila that if she close her eyes and wished really hard, she could visit the Endless Garden too. So Mila did as she was told, and when she opened her eyes, she found herself in a beautiful garden full of flowers and trees. She heard the sound of running water and followed it to a river.Mila couldn't believe her eyes. Lila had been right - the Endless Garden was magical. She thanked Lila for bringing her there and promised to visit again soon.`
